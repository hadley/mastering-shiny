# Shiny modules {#scaling-modules}

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

As your Shiny app grows you will find it increasingly hard to understand how all the pieces fit together. Or you might find yourself in a place where fixing one problem immediately creates a new problem, and you feel like you're playing wack-a-mole. Or maybe you find yourself spending forever scrolling up and down a veeeeeeery long `app.R` looking for the UI component you're thinking of. These are signs that it's time to break your app up into smaller independent pieces, or **modules**. 

At the simplest level, a module is just a pair of functions (one for UI and one for server) that live in their own file. But these functions are specially designed to give you the benefit of **namespacing**. So far, when writing an app, all IDs (the "names" of the controls) are global; all parts of your server function can see all parts of your UI. Modules give you the ability to create local control that can only be seen within the module. This property is called namespacing because it creates "spaces" of "names" that are isolated from the rest of the world.

Shiny modules require a learning a couple of new ideas, but have a big payoff. Modules enable you to write much more ambitious apps because they support greater isolation and ease reuse:

*   Modules separate subcomponents of your app so that they can only communicate
    is predefined ways. This makes it easier to understand how your app works 
    because you can write, analyse, and test individual components in isolation. 

*   Modules make it easier to reuse code because you can write UI and server 
    functions that work regardless of what IDs have already been used by the 
    app.

These benefits might sound familiar because they're very similar to the benefits that functions bring to your R code. And that's because modules **are** functions; anything you can do with a function, you can do with a module.

```{r setup}
library(shiny)

# This is a new style of module construction that will appear in shiny 1.5.0.
# For now, we're adding a simple shim that you can use on your own, and delete
# when shiny 1.5.0 is out.
moduleServer <- function(id, module) {
  callModule(module, id)
}
```

## Motivation {#module-motivation}

Before we dive into the details of creating modules, it's useful to get some sense for how they change the "shape" of your app. I'm going to borrow an example from [Eric Nantz](https://github.com/rpodcast), who talked about modules at rstudio::conf(2019): <https://youtu.be/ylLLVo2VL50>. Eric was motivated to use modules because he had a big complex app, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:modules-before). Obviously you don't know the specifics of this app, but you can get some sense of the complexity.

```{r modules-before, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL, fig.cap="A rough sketch of a complex app. I've done my best to display it simply in a diagram, but it's still hard to understand what all the pieces are"}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/scaling-modules/before.png", dpi = 300)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:modules-after) shows the how the app looks now, after a rewrite to use modules:

* The app is divided up into pieces, and each piece has a name. Naming the 
  pieces means that the names of the controls can be simpler. For example, 
  previously the app had "session manage" and "session activate", but now we 
  only need "manage" and "activate" because those controls are nested inside 
  the session module.

* Modules are reusable so we can write functions to generates both yellow 
  and both blue components. This significantly reduces the total amount of code
  in the app.

* A module is a black box with defined inputs and outputs. Other modules can
  only communicate via the interface (outside) of a module, they can't reach
  inside and directly inspect or modify the internal controls and reactives. 
  This forces a simpler structure to the whole app.

```{r modules-after, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL, fig.cap="After converting the app to use modules, it's much easier to see the big picture components of the app, and see what is re-used in multiple places (the blue and yellow components)."}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/scaling-modules/after.png", dpi = 300)
```

## Module basics

A module is very similar to an app. Like an app, it's composed of two pieces[^unlike]:

* The **module UI** function that generates the `ui` specification.
* The **module server** function that runs code inside the `server` function.

[^unlike]: But unlike an app, both module UI and server are functions.

The two functions have standard forms. They both take an `id` argument and use it to namespace the module. 

To see how these functions work, we'll start by taking a very simple app that draws a histogram, and turn it into a module. This app will be so simple that there's no real benefit to modularising it, but it will serve to illustrate the basic mechanics before we dive into more realistic, and hence complicated, use cases. 

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput("var", "Variable", names(mtcars)),
  numericInput("bins", "bins", 10, min = 1),
  plotOutput("hist")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  data <- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])
  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    hist(data(), breaks = input$bins, main = input$var)
  })
}
```

To turn this into a module we need to extract code out of the the UI and server and put it in to module UI and server functions. 

### Module UI

We'll start with the module UI. There are two steps:

* Put the UI code inside a function that has an `id` argument.

* Wrap each existing ID in a call to `NS()`, so that (e.g.) `"var"` turns 
  into `NS(id, "var")`.

This yields the following function:

```{r}
histogramUI <- function(id) {
  list(
    selectInput(NS(id, "var"), "Variable", names(mtcars)),
    numericInput(NS(id, "bins"), "bins", 10, min = 1),
    plotOutput(NS(id, "hist"))
  )
}
```

Here I've returned the UI components in a list, but you could also return them in an HTML container like `column()` or a `fluidRow()`. Returning a list is more flexible because it allows the caller of the module to choose the container. But if you always place the module in the same container, you might want to return that instead.

### Module server

Next we tackle the server function. This gets wrapped inside _another_ function which must have an `id` argument. This function calls `moduleServer()` with the `id`, and a function that looks like a regular server function:

```{r}
histogramServer <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    data <- reactive(mtcars[[input$var]])
    output$hist <- renderPlot({
      hist(data(), breaks = input$bins, main = input$var)
    })
  })
}
```

Note that `moduleServer()` takes care of the namespacing for you: `input$var` and  `input$bins` refer to the inputs with names `NS(id, "var")` and `NS(id, "bins")`.

### Updated app

Now that we have the ui and server functions, it's good practice to write a function that uses them to generate an app which we can use for experimentation and testing. (You'll learn more about testing in Chapter XXXXX.)

```{r}
histogramApp <- function() {
  ui <- fluidPage(
    histogramUI("hist1")
  )
  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    histogramServer("hist1")
  }
  shinyApp(ui)  
}
```

### Namespacing

Now that we have a complete app, lets circle back and talk about namespacing a little more. The key idea that makes namespacing work is that the ID (the name) of each component is now determined by two pieces: 

* The first piece comes from the module **user**
* The second piece comes from the the module **author**. 

This two-part creation means that you as a module author don't need to worry about clashing with other UI components created by the user. You have your own "space" of names that you control.

The module UI and server differ slightly in how the namespacing is expressed:

* In the module UI, the namespacing is explicit: you have to call `NS()` 
  every time you create an input or output.
  
* In the module server, the namespacing is implicit. You only need to use `id` 
  in the call to `moduleServer()` and then Shiny automatically namespaces 
  `input` and `output` so that your module code can only access elements with 
  the matching `id`. 

Just like regular inputs/output and reactives, the module UI and server are linked only by a shared ID. Otherwise they're black boxes and you can't see inside them. From outside of the module, you can't see any of inputs, outputs, or reactives inside of it. For example, take the app below. The output will never get updated because there is no `input$bins`; the `bins` input can only be seen inside of the `hist1` module. If you want to take input from reactives elsewhere in the app, you'll need to pass them to the module function explicitly; we'll come back to that shortly.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  histogramUI("hist1"),
  textOutput("out")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  histogramServer("hist1")
  output$out <- renderText(paste0("Bins: ", input$bins))
}
```

### Naming conventions

So far we've used a consistent naming scheme for all the components of our module. This consistency is useful to the reader of your code because it advertises that you're using a module, and that the individual components are all connected together. Since the modules draws a histogram, I've called it the `histogram` module. This base name then generates the following names:

* `R/histogram.R` holds all the code for the module. If you're using Shiny
  1.5.0 or greater, this file will be automatically loaded; otherwise you'll 
  need to include a call to `source()` in your `app.R`.

* `histogramUI()` is the module UI. If it provides only input or output 
  controls I'd call it `histogramInput()` or `histogramOuput()` instead.

* `histogramServer()` is the module server.

* `histogramApp()` creates a complete app for interactive experimentation and 
  more formal testing.

## Inputs and outputs

Now that you've seen the basic mechanics of the module UI and server, we can start creating some more useful examples. Sometimes a module with no additional UI or server arguments is useful because it allows you to pull out complex code into its own file so you don't have to worry about it interacting with the rest of the app. But most of the time your modules will need to have some inputs and outputs so they can coordinate with the rest of the app. 

When you first start writing modules, the need to be explicit is going to feel tiresome. And it's certainly more work than the usual free-form association allowed in the server function. But modules enforce specific lines of communication for a reason: they're a little hard to create, in return for a much simpler architecture. You might see advice on-line to use `session$userData` or other techniques to break out of the module straitjacket. Be wary of such advice because violating the namespacing rules is likely to re-introduce much complexity to your app.

Both module UI and server function can take additional arguments. Adding arguments to your UI function allows the user greater control over its appearance, allowing you to use the same module in more places in your app. But at its heart, the module UI is just a regular R function, so there's relatively little specific to learn for Shiny. I'll show a few examples of module UI inputs in passing, but here I'll focus on the module server, showing how to get additional data in to, and out of, your modules. See Chapter \@ref(action-functions) to learn more about UI functions.

### Getting started: UI input + server output

We'll start by create a module that allows the user from built-in data frames. This isn't terribly useful by itself, but it illustrates some of the basic principles, and it's a useful building block for more complex apps. 

I add one argument to the module UI to make it possible to select built in datasets that are (e.g.) either data frames (`filter = is.data.frame`) or matrices (`filter = is.matrix`). This is minor enhancement to code that you first saw in Section \@ref(adding-ui).

```{r}
datasetInput <- function(id, filter = NULL) {
  names <- ls("package:datasets")
  if (!is.null(filter)) {
    data <- lapply(names, get, "package:datasets")
    names <- names[vapply(data, filter, logical(1))]
  }
  
  selectInput(NS(id, "dataset"), "Pick a dataset", names)
}
```

The module server is also simple: we just use `get()` to retrieve the dataset using its name. There's one new idea. Like a function and unlike a regular server function, most modules return a value. Like regular functions, the return value is the last expression processed in the function; in a module server it will almost always be a reactive:

```{r}
datasetServer <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    reactive(get(input$dataset, "package:datasets"))
  })
}
```

To use a module server that returns a value, you capture its value using `<-`. You can see that in our module app: we create a new reactive `data` that's then used to generate output.

```{r}
datasetApp <- function(filter = NULL) {
  ui <- fluidPage(
    datasetInput("dataset", filter = filter),
    tableOutput("data")
  )
  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    data <- datasetServer("dataset")
    output$data <- renderTable(head(data()))
  }
  shinyApp(ui, server)
}
# datasetApp(is.data.frame)
```

I've made a few design decisions in this app function:

* The app function takes an argument passed along to the module UI; 
  this allows you to experiment with different variations of the input.

* I use a tabular output to look at the data. It doesn't really matter what 
  output I use here, but the more expressive it is, the easier it is to 
  check that the app does what I expect.

### Case study: numeric variable selector

Start with a simple module that allows the user to select any numeric variable from a reactive data frame. The input is very simple, it's just a `selectInput()`: (we'll fill in the choices shortly)

```{r}
selectNumericVarInput <- function(id) {
  selectInput(NS(id, "var"), "Variable", choices = NULL) 
}
```

The module server needs to do two things:

* Update the choices in the input when the dataset changes. 

* Return the values of the variable. (This is a design decision; it other 
  contexts it might make more sense to return the name)
  
This time the module server has an argument: the dataset to select variables from. That needs to be a reactive (more on that shortly), so we check it is indeed a reactive, and then we use it like `data()` everywhere.

```{r}
selectNumericVarServer <- function(id, data) {
  stopifnot(is.reactive(data))
  
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    observeEvent(data(), {
      is_numeric <- vapply(data(), is.numeric, logical(1))
      updateSelectInput(session, "var", choices = names(data())[is_numeric])
    })
    
    reactive(data()[[input$var]])
  })
}
```

Again, we capture the results of the module server and connect it to an output in our module function. The point of this function is to make it possible to test, so we need some way to feed in reactive data frames. That's a good use case for the `dataset` module that we created earlier!

```{r}
selectNumericVarApp <- function() {
  ui <- fluidPage(
    datasetInput("data", is.data.frame),
    selectNumericVarInput("var"),
    verbatimTextOutput("out")
  )
  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    data <- datasetServer("data")
    var <- selectNumericVarServer("var", data)
    output$out <- renderPrint(var())
  }
  
  shinyApp(ui, server)
}
# selectNumericVarApp()
```


### Server inputs

Module server functions can take two types of inputs:

* Static setup inputs. These values are used to initialise the server and do 
  not change.

* Reactive inputs, which allow your module to respond to changes initialised
  by the user. 
  
Most inputs will be reactive, so if you're not sure, you should err on the side of making it a reactive.

stopifnot(is.reactive(df))

Because you will get cryptic error messages if you pass an reactive instead of a constant or a constant instead of a reactive, I strongly recommend adding some basic assertions to the top of your module server. Something like this only takes a minute or so to write, but will save you a long of potential future frustration from using your module incorrectly.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stopifnot(is.reactive(arg1))
stopifnot(!is.reactive(arg2))
```

Note that you should never pass an input directly to an module server. If for example, you pass `input$foo`, it will pass the value of `input$foo` when the app starts, i.e. the initial `value` you set in the control. Instead, you'll need to wrap it in `reactive()` so that it continues to update.

### Case study: histogram

Now lets circle back to original histogram module and refactor it into something more composable. The key challenge of creating modules is creating functions that are flexible enough to be used in multiple places, but simple enough that they can easily be understood. Figuring out how to write functions that are good building blocks is the journey of a life time; expect that you'll have to do it wrong quite a few times before you get it right. (I wish I could offer more concrete advice here, but currently this is a skill that you'll have to refine through practice and conscious reflection.)

To make our histogram module useful, we should be able to apply it to any variable. I also think we should consider an output control. It does include an input, the number of bins, but that's used only to tweak the display, and shouldn't exported from the module.

```{r}
histogramOutput <- function(id) {
  list(
    numericInput(NS(id, "bins"), "bins", 10, min = 1, step = 1),
    plotOutput(NS(id, "hist"))
  )
}
```

This needs to be reactive (since it will change over the lifetime of the app), so we check for it. Also notice the default value: that too must be a reactive value so we create a "constant" reactive.

```{r}
histogramServer <- function(id, x, title = reactive(NULL)) {
  stopifnot(is.reactive(x))
  stopifnot(is.reactive(title))
  
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    output$hist <- renderPlot(
      hist(x(), breaks = input$bins, main = title())
    )
  })
}
```

```{r}
histogramApp <- function() {
  ui <- fluidPage(
    sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
        datasetInput("data", is.data.frame),
        selectNumericVarInput("var"),
      ),
      mainPanel(
        histogramOutput("hist")    
      )
    )
  )
  
  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    data <- datasetServer("data")
    x <- selectNumericVarServer("var", data)
    histogramServer("hist", x)
  }
  shinyApp(ui, server)
} 
# histogramApp()
```

### Multiple outputs

It would be nice if we could label the histogram with the name of the variable that its summarisng. Fixing that problem requires us to look again at our `selectNumericVar` module. We could modify it to return the name of the selected variable, instead of the value, but then the module user would have to do all the subsetting. A better approach would be for the server function to return _both_ the name and the value.

A server function can return multiple values exactly the same way that any R function can return multiple values: by returning a list. Below we modify `selectNumericVarServer()` to return both the name and value, as reactives.

```{r}
selectNumericVarServer <- function(id, data) {
  stopifnot(is.reactive(data))
  
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    observeEvent(data(), {
      is_numeric <- vapply(data(), is.numeric, logical(1))
      updateSelectInput(session, "var", choices = names(data())[is_numeric])
    })
    
    list(
      name = reactive(input$var),
      value = reactive(data()[[input$var]])
    )
  })
}
```

Now we can update our `histogramApp()` to make use of this. The UI stays the same; but now we pass both the selected variable's value and its name to `histogramServer()`.

```{r}
histogramApp <- function() {
  ui <- fluidPage(...)

  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    data <- datasetServer("data")
    x <- selectNumericVarServer("var", data)
    histogramServer("hist", x$value, x$name)
  }
  shinyApp(ui, server)
} 
```

The main challenge with this sort of code is remembering when you use the reactive (e.g. `x$value`) vs. when you use its value (e.g. `x$value()`). Just remember that when passing an argument to a module, you want the module to react to the value changing which means that you have to pass the reactive, not it's current value.

If you find yourself frequently returning multiple value from a reactive, you might also consider using the zeallot package. zeallot provides the  `%<-%` operator which allows you to assign into multiple variables (sometimes called multiple, unpacking, or destructuring assignment). This can useful when returning multiple values because you avoid a layer of indirection.

```{r}
library(zeallot)

histogramApp <- function() {
  ui <- fluidPage(...)

  server <- function(input, output, session) {
    data <- datasetServer("data")
    c(value, name) %<-% selectNumericVarServer("var", data)
    histogramServer("hist", value, name)
  }
  shinyApp(ui, server)
}
```

### Dynamic UI

(If you're using dynamic UI, you need one extra little trick - you can get the current namespace through `session$ns`; and you don't need to explicitly pass the `id`.)

## Reusable components

Once you've master the basic technology of modules, there's still a lot of learn. Often the hardest part is figuring out the best way to decompose your big problem into smaller independent pieces. I include some case studies here to help you get a sense of how this feels, but ultimately it's a skill that can only be learned with practice. Try and set aside some time each week where you're not improving the behaviour or appearance of your app, but simply making it easier to understand. This will make your app easier to change in the future, and as you practice these skills your first attempt will become higher quality.

The following sections show more advanced modules motivated by real problems. 

### Limited selection + other

```{r}
radioButtonsExtraUI <- function(id, label, choices, selected = NULL, placeholder = NULL) {
  radioButtons(NS(id, "primary"), 
    label = label,
    choiceValues = c(names(choices), "other"),
    choiceNames = c(
      unname(choices),
      list(textInput(NS(id, "other"), NULL, placeholder = NULL))
    ),
    selected = selected
  )
}

radioButtonsExtraServer <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    observeEvent(input$other, {
      req(input$other)
      updateRadioButtons(session, "primary", selected = "other")
    })
    
    reactive({
      if (input$primary == "other") {
        input$other
      } else {
        input$primary
      }
    })
  })
}
```

To demonstrate this module, I'll create an app that provides a way to describe gender that is sensitive to the many possible ways that people can express their gender.  For a deeper dive on this issue, and a discussion of why many commonly used way of asking about gender can be hurtful to some people, I recommend reading "Designing forms for gender diversity and inclusion" by Sabrina Fonseca: <https://uxdesign.cc/d8194cf1f51>.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  radioButtonsExtraUI("gender", 
    label = "Gender", 
    choices = list(
      male = "Male",
      female = "Female",
      na = "Prefer not to say"
    ), 
    placeholder = "Self-described", 
    selected = "na"
  ),
  textOutput("txt")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  gender <- radioButtonsExtraServer("gender")

  output$txt <- renderText({
    paste("You chose", gender())
  })
}
```

### Wizard

* Buttons go in container not individual pages.
* Figure out some hack to disable prev button on first page.
* Note that don't need to worry about namespacing UI supplied by module user.

## Single object modules

When some people (like me!) encounter modules for the first time, they immediately attempt to combine the module server and module UI into a single module object. If that didn't occur to you, feel free to skip this last part of the chapter, because it explains why the single object approach is appealing, but only works for the simplest of cases.

To illustrate the problem, lets generalise the motivating example from the first part of the chapter so that the data frame is now a parameter:

```{r}
histogramUI <- function(id, df) {
  list(
    selectInput(NS(id, "var"), "Variable", names(df)),
    numericInput(NS(id, "bins"), "bins", 10, min = 1),
    plotOutput(NS(id, "hist"))
  )
}

histogramServer <- function(id, df) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
    data <- reactive(df[[input$var]])
    output$hist <- renderPlot({
      hist(data(), breaks = input$bins, main = input$var)
    })
  })
}
```

And that leads to the following app:

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  tabsetPanel(
    tabPanel("mtcars", histogramUI("mtcars", mtcars)),
    tabPanel("iris", histogramUI("iris", iris))
  )
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  histogramServer("mtcars", mtcars)
  histogramServer("iris", iris)
}
```

It seems undesirable that we have to repeat both the ID and the name of the dataset in both the UI and server, so it's natural to want to wrap into a single function that returns both the UI and the server:

```{r}
histogramApp <- function(id, df) {
  list(
    ui = histogramUI(id, df), 
    server = histogramServer(id, df)
  )
}
```

Then we define the module outside of the UI and server, extracting elements from the list as needed:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hist1 <- histogramApp("mtcars", mtcars)
hist2 <- histogramApp("iris", iris)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tabsetPanel(
    tabPanel("mtcars", hist1$ui()),
    tabPanel("iris", hist2$ui())
  )
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  hist1$server()
  hist2$server()
}
```

There are two problems with this code. Firstly, it doesn't work, because `moduleFunction()` must be called inside a server function. But imagine that problem didn't exist or you worked around it some other way. There's still a big problem: what if we want to allow the user to select the dataset, i.e. we want to make the `df` argument reactive. That can't work because the module is instantiated before the server function, i.e. before we know that information. 

In Shiny, UI and server are inherently disconnected; Shiny doesn't know which UI invocation belongs to which server session. You can see this pattern throughout Shiny: for example, `plotOutput()` and `renderPlot()` are connected only by shared ID. Writing modules as separate functions reflects that reality: they're distinct functions that are not connected other than through a shared ID.

## Exercises

1. The following app plots user selected variables from the `msleep` dataset 
   for three different types of mammals (carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores), 
   with one tab for each type of mammal. Remove the redundancy in the 
   `selectInput()` definitions with the use of functions.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    
    ui <- fluidPage(
      selectInput(inputId = "x",
                  label = "X-axis:",
                  choices = c("sleep_total", "sleep_rem", "sleep_cycle", 
                              "awake", "brainwt", "bodywt"),
                  selected = "sleep_rem"),
      selectInput(inputId = "y",

2. Continue working with the same app from the previous exercise, and further 
   remove redundancy in the code by modularizing how subsets and plots are 
   created.
   
3. Suppose you have an app that is slow to launch when a user visits it. Can  
   modularizing your app code help solve this problem? Explain your reasoning.

1.  Example passing `input$foo` to reactive and it not working.

1.  The following module input provides a text control that lets you type a
    date in ISO8601 format (yyyy-mm-dd). Complete the module by providing a 
    server function that uses the "error" output to display a message if the
    entered value is not a valid date. You can use `strptime(x, "%Y-%m-%d")`
    to parse the string; it will return `NA` if the value isn't a valid date.

    ```{r}
    ymdDateInput <- function(id, label) {
      label <- paste0(label, " (yyyy-mm-dd)")
      
      fluidRow(
        textInput(NS(id, "date"), label),
        textOutput(NS(id, "error"))
      )
    }
    ```


1.  The following code defines output and server components of a module that 
    takes a numeric input and produces a bulleted list of three summary 
    statistics. Create an app function that allows you to experiment with it.
    The app function should take a data frame as input, and use
    `numericVarSelectInput()` to pick the variable to summarise.

    ```{r}
    summaryOuput <- function(id) {
      tags$ul(
        tags$li("Min: ", textOutput(NS(id, "min"), inline = TRUE)),
        tags$li("Max: ", textOutput(NS(id, "max"), inline = TRUE)),
        tags$li("Missing: ", textOutput(NS(id, "n_na"), inline = TRUE))
      )
    }
    
    summaryServer <- function(id, var) {
      moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {
        rng <- reactive({
          req(var())
          range(var(), na.rm = TRUE)
        })
        
        output$min <- renderText(rng()[[1]])
        output$max <- renderText(rng()[[2]])
        output$n_na <- renderText(sum(is.na(var())))
      })
    }
    ```
